# MRP Platform Demo Flow - Two-Part Manufacturing Journey

## Demo Overview
This demo is structured in two parts to provide a comprehensive understanding of the MRP platform:

**Part 1**: Platform Setup & Foundation - Establishing the core system infrastructure  
**Part 2**: End-to-End Journey - Walking through the complete manufacturing workflow

The prototype focuses heavily on the early stages ‚Äî from quotation and engineering drawings through BOM creation, demand consolidation, and procurement planning ‚Äî while maintaining functional representation of later stages to demonstrate the complete journey.
