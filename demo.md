# MRP Platform Demo Flow - Engineer-to-Order Manufacturing Journey

## Demo Overview
This demo showcases an **Engineer-to-Order (ETO) manufacturing platform** where every customer order requires custom engineering design, detailed cost estimation, and precise production planning. The journey begins with master data setup and flows through quotation development, engineering drawings, project management, work order execution, and final invoicing.

**Part 1**: Master Data Setup & Foundation - Establishing the core ETO system infrastructure  
**Part 2**: End-to-End ETO Journey - Complete workflow from quotation to invoice payment

The prototype demonstrates the complete **engineering-driven manufacturing workflow** ‚Äî from master data configuration and quotation development through engineering drawings, BOQ creation, project management, work order execution, procurement integration, and final delivery with invoicing.
