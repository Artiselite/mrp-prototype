# MRP Platform Demo Flow - Engineer-to-Order Manufacturing Journey

## Demo Overview
This demo showcases an **Engineer-to-Order (ETO) manufacturing platform** where every customer order requires custom engineering design, detailed cost estimation, and precise production planning. The journey begins with customer requirements and flows through engineering analysis, quotation development, and sales order conversion.

**Part 1**: Platform Setup & Foundation - Establishing the core ETO system infrastructure  
**Part 2**: End-to-End ETO Journey - Walking through the complete engineering-driven workflow

The prototype focuses heavily on the **engineering-driven early stages** ‚Äî from RFQ analysis and engineering drawings through BOM creation, cost estimation, quotation development, and sales order conversion ‚Äî while maintaining functional representation of later stages to demonstrate the complete journey.
